### 🌐 What This Project Covers

#### 1️⃣ Production Deployment Fundamentals

* Differences between local development and production environments
* Common deployment challenges and how to prepare for them
* What makes a Docker container production-ready
* Exposing applications securely to the internet

---

#### 2️⃣ Deployment Scenarios

This project includes practical examples of deploying:

* **Single-container applications**

  * Example: a simple Node.js or Python web app

* **Multi-container applications**

  * Example: frontend + backend + database using Docker Compose

* **Single-host deployments**

  * Running containers on one remote server

### 🖥️ Deployment Approaches Demonstrated

#### 🔧 Self-Managed Deployment

* Provisioning a remote server
* Installing Docker manually
* Running and managing containers directly
* Full control over infrastructure with higher maintenance responsibility

#### ☁️ Managed Deployment

* Using container orchestration and hosting services such as:

  * AWS ECS
  * AWS Fargate
* Reduced operational overhead with more automation
* Cloud-native container execution

### 🧰 Tools & Platforms

* **Docker & Docker Compose**
* **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** for deployment examples
* Cloud-agnostic concepts applicable to:

  * DigitalOcean
  * Google Cloud Platform
  * Microsoft Azure
  * Render
  * Hetzner

> While AWS is used in examples, the core deployment principles apply to any cloud provider.
