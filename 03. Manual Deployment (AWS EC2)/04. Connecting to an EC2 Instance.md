# ✅ **Connecting to an EC2 Instance**

After launching an EC2 instance, AWS opens a **wizard** to configure your new cloud server.

---

# 🧩 **1. Choose the Operating System (AMI)**

You should select:

➡️ **Amazon Linux AMI** (64-bit, x86)
This will be the OS installed on your virtual server.

---

# 🧩 **2. Choose the Instance Type**

Select:

➡️ **t2.micro** (Free Tier eligible)

Instance types vary by CPU and memory.
For this simple demo, the smallest free-tier instance is enough.

---

# 🧩 **3. Instance Details: VPC**

Make sure you have a:

* **Default VPC** selected
  or
* **Create a new VPC** if none exists

Leave **all other defaults** unchanged.

Then click:

➡️ **Review and Launch**

---

# 🧩 **4. Create a Key Pair (Important!)**

This key pair allows SSH authentication.

Steps:

1. Choose **Create new key pair**
2. Give it a name (e.g., `example-1`)
3. Click **Download Key Pair**
4. Store it safely (ONLY you should have this file)

⚠️ If you lose the key, you **cannot access the instance**. You must delete and recreate it.

Then click:

➡️ **Launch Instances**

---

# 🧩 **5. Wait Until the Instance Is Running**

Click **View Instances** and wait for the status to become:

* **Running**
* Status checks passed

---

# 🧩 **6. Connect to the Instance via SSH**

You connect from your local machine (terminal) to the EC2 instance.

SSH = Secure Shell
A protocol used to securely access remote machines via terminal.

### 🖥 For macOS & Linux

SSH works **out of the box** in the terminal.

### 🪟 For Windows

Windows does *not* include SSH by default (unless using PowerShell/OpenSSH on newer versions), so you must:

**Option 1:** Install **WSL2**, which gives you a Linux shell
**Option 2:** Use **PuTTY** (a GUI SSH client)

---

# 🧩 **7. Using the AWS “Connect” Button**

In the EC2 dashboard:

* Select your instance
* Click **Connect**
* Choose **SSH Client**

AWS gives you:

* A `chmod` command (Linux/macOS/WSL only)
* An SSH command to connect, similar to:

```
chmod 400 example-1.pem
ssh -i example-1.pem ec2-user@YOUR_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP
```

### Windows + PuTTY users

⚠️ Skip the `chmod` step.
PuTTY provides a GUI to load the key file.
AWS also links to their detailed PuTTY guide.

---

# 🧩 **8. Connect**

Run the SSH command in the same folder as your `.pem` file.

* On first connection, type `yes` to confirm.
* You’ll see a prompt like:

```
ec2-user@ip-xx-xx-xx-xx
```

```
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-4-236 ~]$ |
```

This confirms you are now **inside the EC2 machine**.

---

# 🎉 You Are Now Connected!

Everything you run in this terminal now runs **on the cloud machine**, not your local system.

Next steps will be:

1. Install Docker on the EC2 instance
2. Transfer your Docker image (or pull it)
3. Run your Docker container
4. Configure security groups to expose required ports
5. Test the deployed application
