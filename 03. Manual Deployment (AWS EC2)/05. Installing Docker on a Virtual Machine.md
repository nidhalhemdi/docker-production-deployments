# ✅ **Installing Docker on an EC2 Virtual Machine**

Once your EC2 instance is running and you are connected to it via SSH, the next step is to **install Docker on the remote machine**.


# 🧩 **1. Update all packages**

Run this first to ensure your system has the latest package versions:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

---

# 🧩 **2. Install Docker**

```bash
sudo yum -y install docker
```

This installs:

* the Docker engine
* all needed dependencies

---

# 🧩 **3. Start the Docker service**

```bash
sudo service docker start
```

This starts Docker so the daemon is running.

---

# 🧩 **4. Add `ec2-user` to the docker group**

This allows you to run Docker commands *without sudo*:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
```

---

# 🧩 **5. Log out and log back in**

This step is **required** for the new group permissions to take effect.

If you skip it, Docker will say:

> "permission denied"
> or
> "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"

---

# 🧩 **6. Enable Docker to start automatically**

After logging back in:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

This ensures Docker always starts when the instance reboots.

---

# 🧩 **7. Verify the installation**

Run:

```bash
docker version
```

If Docker is correctly installed, you’ll see client and server version information.

---

# 🎉 Docker is now installed on your EC2 instance!

You can now:

* pull Docker images
* run containers
* deploy your application
