# **More on AWS**

This section pauses the technical workflow to clarify **two important AWS concepts** you will see repeatedly in the rest of this project:

* the *AWS basics* (VPCs, subnets, general cloud concepts)
* *Fargate*, the container runtime used by ECS

---

# **1. Recommended AWS Basics (Optional but Useful)**

We suggest learning some foundational AWS concepts to better understand what’s going on behind the scenes when deploying with ECS.

### **Key AWS resources recommended:**

* The **AWS Basics**
* Especially **VPCs and Subnets**

### **Why?**

Throughout this section, AWS ECS will automatically create and use:

* **VPCs** (Virtual Private Clouds)
* **Subnets**
* **Security groups**
* **Routing rules**

These are fundamental networking concepts in AWS.

# **2. What is AWS Fargate? (Important)**

When you created your ECS task in the previous step, you used **Fargate**, which is an AWS-managed container runtime.

### **What Fargate does:**

* Runs your containers **without you managing servers or EC2 instances**
* Creates the underlying compute resources **only when needed**
* Keeps everything fully managed

  * You don’t update servers
  * You don’t patch OS updates
  * You don’t manage scaling manually

### **Analogy:**

Fargate = “serverless Docker host managed by AWS.”

You define:

* Which container
* How much CPU
* How much memory

AWS handles everything else.

---

# **3. Task Size (CPU & Memory Settings)**

During task definition, you choose:

* CPU units
* Memory (RAM)

These settings determine:

* How much compute power your container gets
* How much you pay

**Smallest values = cheapest**, ideal for demos.
For real applications, you may need larger values.

---

# **4. Handling High Traffic: Auto Scaling**

If your Fargate task gets more requests than it can handle:

* More CPU/RAM might help
* **Or** you can configure **Auto Scaling** for ECS services

ECS Auto Scaling allows AWS to:

* Launch multiple containers (tasks)
* Distribute traffic between them

This is useful for:

* High-load situations
* Production workloads

It’s not covered in detail here because the project aims at fundamentals.

---

# **5. What to Take Away**

* ECS uses AWS networking (VPCs, subnets), so basic AWS knowledge helps.
* Fargate = serverless container runtime → no servers for you to manage.
* Task size determines container performance and cost.
* Auto Scaling enables handling increasing workloads.
* For demo purposes, the smallest settings are enough.
