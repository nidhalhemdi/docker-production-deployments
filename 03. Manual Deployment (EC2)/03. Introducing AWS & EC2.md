Here’s a clear and concise summary of **Section 9 – Introducing AWS & EC2**.

# ✅ **Summary: Introducing AWS & EC2**

### **Goal of this Section**

You have a demo application running inside a Docker image locally.
Now the goal is to **deploy it to a remote server** so anyone in the world can access it — not just you on your local machine.

---

# 🧩 **Step 1: Build the Docker Image**

* As usual, every time the application code changes, you must **rebuild the Docker image**.
* This ensures your image is up-to-date and ready to be deployed.

---

# 🧩 **Step 2: Run the Container on a Remote Server**

Instead of running the container on your local machine, the next step is to run it **on a remote cloud machine**.

We use **AWS** (Amazon Web Services) to create that machine.

---

# 🌩️ **Why AWS?**

AWS provides a service called **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**, which allows you to create:

> “Virtual servers in the cloud”
> or
> “Computers that live on AWS hardware.”

You will deploy your Docker container on one of these virtual machines.

---

# 🛠️ **Setting Up AWS**

* You need an AWS account (requires a credit card).
* Everything shown here is covered by the **AWS Free Tier**.
* After logging in, you see the **AWS Management Console**.

Because AWS has many services, you use the **search bar** to find the one you need.

---

# 🔍 **Search for EC2**

EC2 = service for creating and managing virtual cloud servers.

Once you open the **EC2 dashboard**, you may see:

* A standard dashboard, or
* A “Get Started” page

Either way, the goal is the same:

---

# 🚀 **Launch a New EC2 Instance**

An **EC2 instance** is:

* a virtual machine
* in the cloud
* where you will eventually run your Docker container

You click **"Launch Instance"** to create a new cloud-based server.

This is the machine where you will:

* install Docker
* copy your image or pull it
* run your container
* expose it to the internet for public access
