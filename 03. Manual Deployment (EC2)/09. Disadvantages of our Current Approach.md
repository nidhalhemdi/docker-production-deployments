# **Disadvantages of our Current Approach**

# 🚫 **Why the EC2 + SSH + Manual Docker Deployment Is NOT Ideal**

In the previous step, we deployed a Dockerized app to an EC2 instance manually.
This works and demonstrates the power of Docker — but it has **major drawbacks**.

We call this the **“do-it-yourself (DIY) approach.”**

Below are the disadvantages explained clearly:

---

# 🧱 1. **You Fully Own (and Manage) the Server**

When you use EC2 like this:

* You create the server yourself
* You configure everything yourself
* You maintain everything yourself

This means **you are responsible for EVERYTHING**:

### 🔥 System responsibility

* Keeping the operating system updated
* Ensuring the machine has enough CPU/RAM
* Upgrading the instance if traffic increases
* Managing storage
* Making sure Docker versions stay current

### 🔥 Security responsibility

* Configuring firewalls (security groups)
* Ensuring no ports are accidentally exposed
* Securing SSH access
* Preventing hacking and abuse
* Understanding networking and Linux admin basics

If you misconfigure something → your server can be hacked.

For most developers, this is **outside their skillset**.

---

# 🛠 2. **Lots of Manual Work**

You must:

* Create EC2 instance manually
* SSH into it manually
* Install Docker manually
* Set up permissions manually
* Pull images manually
* Run containers manually

This is okay for learning.
But for real projects, it becomes **annoying, error-prone, and slow**.

---

# 🔄 3. **Deployment Workflow Is Not Developer-Friendly**

Deploying updates requires many steps:

* Rebuild locally
* Push to Docker Hub
* SSH into EC2
* Stop container
* Pull latest image
* Run container again

There is **no automation**, **no simple deploy command**, and no CI/CD.

Modern deployment should be:

> “Run one command, code gets deployed safely.”

Not:
“SSH, pull, stop, start, check logs, etc.”

---

# 🧩 4. **Not Good for Larger / Multi-Container Apps**

With this EC2 setup:

* Docker Compose can run — **but it is not ideal**
* You must manage networks, volumes, containers manually
* Scaling multiple containers gets complicated
* No load balancing, monitoring, or service discovery

Real production apps need:

* Multiple containers
* Automatic restarts
* Scaling
* Load balancing
* Managed databases
* Zero downtime deployments

EC2 + manual Docker provides **none** of that.

---

# 🌩 5. **Better Options Exist**

AWS provides **managed services** where:

* You don’t manage servers
* OS updates happen automatically
* Docker containers run on managed systems
* Scaling happens automatically
* No SSH needed
* No manual updates
* Security handled for you

These include:

### ✔ AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)

### ✔ AWS Fargate (serverless containers)

### ✔ AWS EKS (Kubernetes, fully managed)

### ✔ Other managed container platforms

---

# 🎯 **Conclusion**

The EC2 manual deployment method is useful to learn **how containers work on remote hosts**, but:

❌ too much manual work
❌ developer-unfriendly
❌ insecure if misconfigured
❌ hard to maintain
❌ not scalable
❌ not suitable for production

A **managed container service** is almost always the better choice.
