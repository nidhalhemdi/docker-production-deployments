# **Pushing Our Local Image to the Cloud**

---

--> Get your **local Docker image** onto your **remote EC2 machine** so you can run it there.

To achieve this, you **should NOT build the image on the EC2 server**.
Instead, you:

1. **Build the image locally**
2. **Push it to Docker Hub**
3. **Pull it on the EC2 instance**

This is simpler, faster, and avoids unnecessary work on the remote machine.

---

# 🚫 Option That You SHOULD NOT Use

### **Building the image on the EC2 machine**

* Requires copying your source code to the server
* Requires running `docker build` on the server
* Causes unnecessary complexity
* Slower and error-prone

---

# ✅ Recommended Option

### **Build image locally → push to Docker Hub → pull on EC2**

This is the preferred, professional workflow.

---

# 🧩 **Step-by-Step Summary**

---

## **1. Create a repository on Docker Hub**

* Log in to Docker Hub
* Click **Create Repository**
* Name it something like **node-example-1**
* Choose **Public** (private is limited unless paid)

---

## **2. Prepare your project locally**

Add a **.dockerignore** file to prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being added to the image:

```
node_modules
Dockerfile
*.pem
```

(Prevents accidentally pushing your EC2 key!)

---

## **3. Build the image locally**

In your local terminal (NOT the SSH terminal):

```bash
docker build . -t node-dep-example-1
```

---

## **4. Tag the image with your Docker Hub repository**

Tag format:

```
docker tag LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/REPO_NAME
```

Example from the lecture:

```bash
docker tag node-dep-example-1 nidhalhaamdii/node-example-1
```

Use **your own Docker Hub username**.

---

## **5. Log into Docker Hub from the terminal**

```bash
docker login
```

Enter your Docker Hub username + password.

---

## **6. Push the image to Docker Hub**

```bash
docker push nidhalhaamdii/node-example-1
```

(or your repository name)

Now your remote EC2 machine can pull it.

---

# 🎯 **Result**

Your image is now stored in Docker Hub.

On the EC2 instance, you will simply run:

```bash
docker pull your-username/your-repo
docker run ...
```

That’s the entire pipeline.
